# Media-Launcher
This is a Media Launcher that I made to quickly access the media I enjoy watching.
It is coded in Python and uses the subprocess and time libraries.
The subprocess library is used to open URL's on Google Chrome (required for this program to work)
It is made to be easy to use for friends and family for when we want to watch something together using my laptop.
